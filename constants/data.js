    description: [
      `As an Engineer, I love solving problems and understanding the logic behind everything. That is also why I like programming, I get to solve problems using logic and at the same time I get to create a work of art.`,
      `I have always been fascinated by programming but I felt I lacked the right foundation for success. I read books and I created a few projects in Java but the technologies and languages seemed endless. I wanted to build a solid foundation and teach myself a useful skill.`,
      `I chose to study Web Development through Thinkful's program. It taught me everything from the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node, Test-Driven Development, Data Structures and Algorithms. All the while building projects and completing challenges along the way. If I have learned anything from my experience, it is that I love to learn and create.`,
