      `As an Engineer, I am motivated to solve problems and passionate about fully understanding the logic that powers process and applications. Solving problems and architecting reusable solutions are why I enjoy programming.`,
      `I have always been fascinated by programming, but felt I lacked the right foundation for success. I have read books and created a few projects utilizing Java but have always been eager to extend my capabilities into the vast array of technologies and languages available.`,
      `I chose to study Web Development through Thinkful's program. It taught me everything from the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node, Test-Driven Development, Data Structures and Algorithms. All the while building projects and completing challenges along the way. If I have learned anything from my experience, it is that I love to learn and create.`,
