    description: [
      `As an artist, I love learning about new artmaking methods and planning out dreamlike paintings. As a developer, I love solving problems and learning new technologies.`,
      `I've been learning about web development for about 1 year since the start of January 2021. I was interested in learning how to build a website for myself to showcase my artworks, but I ended up loving the process because it was so similar to artmaking. I felt naturally at-home in this new environment where I could put my art and design skills to good use.`,
      `After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first 6 months, I felt I wasn't learning efficiently so I researched about other learning methods. One that stood out to me was a coding bootcamp called Thinkful. So, I signed up for their software engineering program where I flourished under a structured learning experience. Over the next 6 months, I learned React, Bootstrap, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Test-Driven Development, Software Architecture, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Outside of the program, I taught myself other technologies like Tailwind CSS and NextJS.`,
